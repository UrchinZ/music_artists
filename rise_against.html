The cornerstone of good punk rock and hardcore, much like Festivus at
 the Costanza household, centers on the airing of grievances. And more 
 often than not, the weightier the target of criticism, the richer the 
 rewards. Rise Against are one band holding firm in the belief that 
 it’s important for punk to stand for something real, and they’ve 
 carried the torch for thoughtful, socially conscious punk rock for
  more than a decade.

<p id ="des">Rise Against is an American melodic hardcore band from Chicago, Illinois, 
formed in 1999. The band's current line-up comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist
 Tim McIlrath, lead guitarist Zach Blair, bassist Joe Principe and drummer
  Brandon Barnes. Former members are guitarists Dan Wlekinski, Kevin White,
   Todd Mohney and Chris Chasse, and drummers Toni Tintari and Dan Lumley. <br>
The band spent its first four years signed to the independent record label
 Fat Wreck Chords, on which it released two studio albums, The Unraveling (2001) 
 and Revolutions per Minute (2003). Both the albums met with considerable underground
  success, and in 2003 the band signed with the major label Geffen. Their major label 
  debut Siren Song of the Counter Culture (2004) brought the band mainstream success,
   producing several successful singles. Their next two albums, The Sufferer & the Witness
    (2006) and Appeal to Reason (2008), were also successful and peaked at number ten and
     number three on the Billboard 200 chart, respectively. Appeal to Reason was followed
      three years later by Endgame (2011).[1] All four albums released via Geffen were certified 
      platinum in Canada, while three of these albums were certified gold in the United States.<br>
Rise Against is also known for their advocacy of progressivism, supporting organisations 
such as Amnesty International and the It Gets Better Project. The band actively promotes
 animal rights and most of the members are straight edge (excluding Barnes), PETA supporters 
 and vegetarians.
